# Copilot instructions for this repo

These instructions apply to **every GitHub Copilot interaction on this repository**, including code review on pull requests.

## Review philosophy

When reviewing a PR, **default to approval**. The author has already thought about their change, it has already passed CI, and the maintainers are going to review it themselves. Copilot's job is to catch the *small number of real issues* a human reviewer might miss — not to re-litigate every line.

A good review on this repo posts **zero comments** most of the time. Two or three comments on a ~30-file PR is already a lot. If you find yourself writing a fourth comment, stop and ask whether any of the first three are actually worth posting.

## What to comment on

Post a review comment **only** when one of the following is clearly true:

- **Bug**: the code will produce incorrect output, crash, or fail to behave as its name / surrounding comments / tests promise.
- **Security issue**: injection, auth bypass, secret leak, SSRF, prototype pollution, insecure defaults, missing authn/authz on an endpoint that should have it.
- **Crash or unhandled error path**: null dereference, unhandled promise rejection, missing `await` on something whose result matters, infinite loop / recursion, resource leak (unclosed handles, lingering timers, growing maps).
- **Production misconfiguration**: anything that works in dev but would break in production — wrong path resolution post-build, env var assumed to exist, routing that shadows API endpoints, etc.
- **Contract break**: a public API shape (HTTP response, exported type, CLI flag) changes in a way that callers aren't updated for.
- **Data-loss or destructive operation** without guards.

When you post one of these, be specific: name the exact failure scenario, not "this could be problematic".

## What NOT to comment on

Do not post a comment for any of the following. These waste the author's time and create review loops:

- **Style / formatting / naming preferences.** Renaming `foo` to `fooValue`, "consider using an arrow function", "prefer `const` here" — skip.
- **"Could be clearer" / "consider extracting a helper" / "this is a bit long".** Subjective readability is not your call.
- **Missing comments, docstrings, or log lines** unless the absence actively hides a bug. The repo has its own conventions for when to document; trust the author.
- **Minor duplication** (three similar lines, two `if`s that could be one). Premature abstraction is worse than repetition.
- **Test organization nits** (split this test, rename that one, add one more edge case). Only comment if a test is *incorrect*, not if it's merely incomplete.
- **Dependency-version suggestions** unless there's a known CVE in the pinned version.
- **"You could also use library X"** — the author already chose the approach.
- **Inconsistency with other files** unless the inconsistency causes a bug.
- **Preference between two equally valid patterns** (e.g. guard clause vs. nested if, `for` vs. `map`).
- **Speculative future problems** ("what if someone later…"). Today's code, today's problems.
- **Restating what the code already makes obvious.**

If a comment would fit into any of the categories above, **do not post it**. Silence is a valid review outcome.

## How to phrase comments you do post

- Open with the failure mode, not the suggestion. "`req.path.startsWith('/api')` misses the exact path `/api`, so `GET /api` returns the SPA instead of Nest's 404" is useful. "Consider also handling `/api`" is not.
- Keep them short. Two or three sentences. Link to a line if the bug depends on context elsewhere.
- Suggest *a* fix, don't dictate *the* fix. The author knows the codebase better than you do.
- Never post a summary comment or a "reviewed files" table unless specifically asked.

## Repo-specific context

- **Framework**: Nest.js (on `@nestjs/platform-express`) + TypeScript backend, React/Vite frontend, Terraform + AWS.
- **DI**: Nest's built-in `@Injectable()` providers. Do not suggest switching to tsyringe, InversifyJS, or manual wiring — we just migrated off tsyringe deliberately.
- **No linter is configured.** Do not comment on "this would fail eslint" or style the linter would catch — we intentionally don't run one.
- **Test naming**: `it('should …')`. Don't suggest `it('does …')` or the reverse — the repo convention is `should`.
- **No `as unknown as T` casts in tests.** Prefer `vi.mocked(fn)` or `Partial<T>` + single `as T`.
- **ESM-only.** The project is `"type": "module"`. Imports must use `.js` extensions. Don't suggest removing them.
- **Squash-merge.** PR title becomes the commit subject on `main`, so the title must start with a Conventional Commits prefix (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `style`), optionally with a scope. If a PR title is missing this, that *is* worth commenting on — it's a real issue that surfaces on `main`.
- **The `game_servers` Terraform map is the single source of truth.** Don't suggest hand-writing per-game resources — they all `for_each` over this map.
- **DNS is Lambda-managed, not Terraform-managed.** Don't suggest adding `aws_route53_record` resources.
- **Watchdog state lives in ECS task tags.** Don't suggest adding DynamoDB / SSM / Redis for this.
- **Lambda env var `AWS_REGION_`** (trailing underscore) is intentional — `AWS_REGION` is reserved by the Lambda runtime. Don't suggest renaming.

## When in doubt

Skip the comment. A missed nitpick costs nothing. A noisy review burns author time and trust.
