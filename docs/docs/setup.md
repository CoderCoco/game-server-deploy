# Setup guide

This is the end-to-end walkthrough, from a blank AWS account to a running
Fargate task you can connect to from your game client, plus the optional
Discord bot. Allow ~30 minutes the first time; most of that is waiting for
`terraform apply`.

The [submodule guide](/guides/submodule) covers the
alternative workflow of vendoring this repo inside a private parent that
holds `terraform.tfvars` and state. Come back here afterwards for the
per-step detail.

## Prerequisites

On the machine that will run `terraform apply` and the management app:

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Node.js | 20+ | Enforced by `setup.sh` and the Nest server boot. |
| npm | 10+ | Ships with Node 20. |
| Terraform | 1.5+ | Installed automatically by `setup.sh` on Debian/Ubuntu. |
| AWS CLI | v2 | Installed automatically by `setup.sh` on Linux. |
| Docker | 24+ | Only if you plan to run the app via `docker compose`. |

On the AWS side you need:

- An AWS account you control (pure personal use is fine).
- **A Route 53 hosted zone you already own** — e.g. `yourdomain.com`.
  Terraform looks it up as a data source and will not create it for you.
  If you use an external registrar, delegate the zone's NS records to
  Route 53 before running Terraform or DNS updates will go nowhere.

## 1. Create and authorise an IAM user

1. In the **[AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)** →
   **Users → Create user**, give it a name like `game-server-deploy`.
2. On the permissions step, choose **Attach policies directly** and skip
   through without selecting any managed policy. Create the user.
3. Open the new user → **Permissions → Add permissions → Create inline
   policy → JSON**. Paste the policy below, name it `GameServerDeployAll`,
   and save.
4. **Security credentials → Create access key → Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
   Copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. Treat the secret like a
   password — AWS will not show it again.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "GameServerDeploy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecs:*",
        "elasticfilesystem:*",
        "ec2:*",
        "lambda:*",
        "logs:*",
        "cloudwatch:*",
        "events:*",
        "route53:*",
        "ce:*",
        "elasticloadbalancing:*",
        "acm:*",
        "dynamodb:*",
        "secretsmanager:*",
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "GameServerIAM",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/game-servers-*",
        "arn:aws:iam::*:policy/game-servers-*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Why one inline policy instead of stacking managed policies?** AWS caps
> each user at 10 directly-attached managed policies, and this stack touches
> ~14 services. One inline policy also keeps the full blast radius visible
> in one place. Trade-off: you lose AWS's auto-maintenance of action lists,
> but since everything is `{service}:*` there is nothing to maintain.

> **`iam:*` is scoped to project-prefixed ARNs**, not `Resource: *`, to avoid
> granting `iam:PassRole` on every role in the account. The `game-servers-*`
> prefix matches the default `project_name`. If you change `project_name` in
> `terraform.tfvars`, update the two ARN patterns in `GameServerIAM` to match.

You also need a tiny extra permission that is **not** in any AWS-managed
policy: the AWS provider tags EventBridge rules on creation, which requires
`events:TagResource`, `events:UntagResource`, and `events:ListTagsForResource`.
`events:*` above already grants these — if you tighten the policy later, keep
those three actions in.

## 2. Configure the AWS CLI

```bash
aws configure
#   AWS Access Key ID:     AKIA...
#   AWS Secret Access Key: ****
#   Default region name:   us-east-1          # must match terraform.tfvars
#   Default output format: json

aws sts get-caller-identity                   # verify
```

Both Terraform and the management app read `~/.aws/credentials` and
`~/.aws/config` automatically. If you prefer environment variables, export
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
instead — the management app will pick them up too.

## 3. Clone and bootstrap

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codercoco/game-server-deploy.git
cd game-server-deploy
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` is idempotent — safe to re-run at any time. It:

1. Checks for Node 20+, and installs Terraform and the AWS CLI if missing
   (Debian/Ubuntu only; macOS users should install those manually first).
2. Runs `npm ci` from `app/` so all workspaces are installed.
3. Runs `npm run build:lambdas` to produce `app/packages/lambda/*/dist/handler.cjs`
   — Terraform's `archive_file` data sources zip these at apply time, so
   the bundles **must** exist on disk before `terraform apply` or init will
   fail.
4. Copies `terraform/terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform/terraform.tfvars`
   if the latter doesn't exist yet.
5. Creates the S3 state bucket (`{project_name}-tf-state`) and DynamoDB lock
   table (`{project_name}-tf-locks`) if they don't already exist. The bucket
   gets versioning, public-access blocking, and AES-256 encryption enabled.
   The script waits for the DynamoDB table to reach `ACTIVE` status before
   continuing. Both names are derived from `project_name` in
   `terraform.tfvars` (default: `game-servers`). This step requires the
   `s3:*` permissions in the inline policy above.
6. Runs `terraform init` inside `terraform/`, passing the bucket and table
   as `-backend-config` flags. If a local `terraform.tfstate` is present
   (migrating from a previous local-backend setup), it automatically
   migrates state to S3 without prompting.

## 4. Configure your servers

Open `terraform/terraform.tfvars` in your editor and fill in:

```hcl
aws_region       = "us-east-1"
project_name     = "game-servers"
hosted_zone_name = "yourdomain.com"    # must already exist in Route 53

# Watchdog knobs (defaults shown)
watchdog_interval_minutes = 15
watchdog_idle_checks      = 4          # 15 × 4 = 60 min grace before auto-stop
watchdog_min_packets      = 100

# One entry per game. Everything downstream iterates over this map.
game_servers = {
  palworld = {
    image  = "thijsvanloef/palworld-server-docker:latest"
    cpu    = 2048
    memory = 8192
    ports = [
      { container = 8211,  protocol = "udp" },
      { container = 27015, protocol = "udp" },
    ]
    environment = [
      { name = "PLAYERS",        value = "8" },
      { name = "SERVER_NAME",    value = "My Palworld Server" },
      { name = "ADMIN_PASSWORD", value = "CHANGE_ME" },
    ]
    efs_path = "/palworld"
    https    = false
  }
}
```

Rules worth knowing before you save:

- **`efs_path`** maps to a dedicated EFS access point — each game is isolated
  in its own directory with UID/GID 1000 ownership. Game images that run as
  a different UID will fail to mount.
- **`https = true`** routes the game through an ALB + ACM + Route 53 ALIAS.
  Only set it on games that actually serve HTTP(S); UDP games (most game
  servers) must stay `false`. The ALB is only created if at least one game
  has `https = true`.
- **CPU / memory** must be a valid Fargate pair (see the
  [Fargate task size table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_size)).
- **Do not write `aws_route53_record` resources** — the update-dns Lambda
  owns that.

Optionally seed Discord credentials here too. If you leave them out, you can
paste them into the dashboard later:

```hcl
discord_application_id = "123456789012345678"
discord_bot_token      = "xxxx.yyyy.zzzz"          # sensitive
discord_public_key     = "abcd...ef01"             # sensitive
```

`terraform.tfvars` is gitignored, so these stay on your machine. Rotation
after the first apply takes one `terraform taint`; see the
[submodule guide](/guides/submodule) for the pattern
that puts this file in a private parent repo.

## 5. Apply the infrastructure

```bash
cd terraform
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

`apply` takes 5–10 minutes end-to-end. It creates the VPC, two public
subnets, an ECS cluster, one task definition + EFS access point +
CloudWatch log group **per game**, the four Lambdas, a DynamoDB table, two
Secrets Manager secrets, the EventBridge rule + schedule, and (if any game
has `https = true`) an ALB with an ACM certificate.

When it finishes, note two outputs:

- `interactions_invoke_url` — the Lambda Function URL you'll paste into the
  Discord Developer Portal for the bot.
- `ecs_cluster_name` / `game_names` — used by the dashboard (it reads
  `terraform.tfstate` directly, so you normally don't need to copy these
  by hand).

## 6. Run the management app

Pick one.

### Option A — dev mode

```bash
cd app
npm run dev
```

Serves the Nest API on **:3001** and the Vite dev server on **:5173** (with
`/api` proxied to :3001). Open `http://localhost:5173`. In dev mode, if no
`API_TOKEN` is configured the app logs a warning and allows unauthenticated
requests — fine for local iteration, not safe to expose.

### Option B — Docker (production-equivalent)

```bash
# First run only: ensure the persisted config file exists on the host so
# Compose can bind-mount it.  Without this the bind will error.
touch app/server_config.json

# REQUIRED: the app refuses to start in production without a bearer token.
export API_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

docker compose up --build
```

Opens on `http://localhost:5000`. The dashboard will prompt you for the
token on first load; paste the value of `$API_TOKEN` and click
**Save & reload**.

`docker-compose.yml` bind-mounts `./terraform` read-only (for
`terraform.tfstate`), `./app/server_config.json` (persisted watchdog
config), and `~/.aws` (credentials). If you prefer
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env vars, uncomment the
corresponding block in `docker-compose.yml`.

## 7. (Optional) Wire up the Discord bot

The serverless bot is two Lambdas, one DynamoDB table, and two Secrets
Manager secrets — all created by `terraform apply` in step 5. You now
connect it to a Discord application.

1. **Create a Discord application** at
   [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → **New Application** →
   add a **Bot**. Copy three values from **General Information**:

   | Value | Where it goes | Used for |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Application ID** (Client ID) | DynamoDB `CONFIG#discord` row | Needed when the server registers slash commands for a guild. Public, not a secret. |
   | **Bot Token** | Secrets Manager `${project_name}/discord/bot-token` | `Authorization: Bot <token>` for the REST call that registers commands. Treat like a password. |
   | **Application Public Key** | Secrets Manager `${project_name}/discord/public-key` | The interactions Lambda verifies every incoming interaction against this Ed25519 key. |

   You do **not** need any Privileged Gateway Intents — HTTP interactions
   deliver the invoker's role IDs directly in the request body.

2. **Seed the credentials.** Either:
   - Set `discord_application_id`, `discord_bot_token`, and
     `discord_public_key` in `terraform.tfvars` and re-apply. Terraform
     writes them once and then `ignore_changes` lets the dashboard edit
     them without being overwritten on subsequent applies. To rotate via
     tfvars later, `terraform taint` the relevant resource first.
   - Or leave them empty and open the **Credentials** tab in the dashboard;
     paste and Save. The dashboard writes directly to DynamoDB and Secrets
     Manager.

3. **Copy the interactions endpoint URL** (the `interactions_invoke_url`
   Terraform output, also shown in the dashboard Credentials tab) into the
   Discord Developer Portal under **General Information → Interactions
   Endpoint URL → Save**. Discord sends a PING on save; the Lambda replies
   PONG and Discord accepts the URL.

4. **Invite the bot to your server.** In the Developer Portal:
   - **Installation → Installation Contexts**: enable **Guild Install**,
     disable **User Install**.
   - **OAuth2 → URL Generator**: tick scopes `bot` and
     `applications.commands`; under **Bot Permissions**, tick
     **Send Messages** and **Use Slash Commands** (Discord's UI name for
     the `USE_APPLICATION_COMMANDS` permission).
   - Open the generated URL and add the bot to your server.

5. **Enable Developer Mode in Discord** (User Settings → Advanced →
   Developer Mode) so you can right-click servers/users/roles and
   **Copy ID**.

6. **In the dashboard's Discord Bot panel:**
   - **Guilds tab**: add the guild ID and click **Register commands** so
     Discord learns about `/server-start`, `/server-stop`, `/server-status`,
     `/server-list`. This is a per-guild REST call; there are no global
     commands.
   - **Admins tab**: user IDs and/or role IDs that can run everything on
     everything.
   - **Per-Game Permissions tab**: for each game, which users/roles can
     invoke which subset of `start` / `stop` / `status`.

The [user guide](/guides/user) has the day-to-day
command reference; the
[interactions/followup Lambda docs](/components/lambdas)
have the wire-level detail.

## 8. Smoke test

With infra applied, the app running, and (optionally) a Discord guild
configured:

1. Open the dashboard → the game you configured should appear as
   **stopped**.
2. Click **Start**. Watch the card transition through `PROVISIONING` →
   `PENDING` → `RUNNING`. DNS is updated by the update-dns Lambda as soon
   as the task reaches RUNNING.
3. `dig {game}.yourdomain.com` should return the task's public IP within
   `dns_ttl` seconds (default 30). Connect your game client.
4. Click **Stop**, or type `/server-stop {game}` in Discord, or do nothing
   for `watchdog_interval_minutes × watchdog_idle_checks` minutes — any of
   the three stops the task and removes the DNS record.

## 9. Tear it down

Stop every server from the dashboard first (so the DNS updater gets a clean
STOPPED event and removes records), then:

```bash
cd terraform
terraform destroy
```

The two Secrets Manager secrets use `recovery_window_in_days = 0`, so they
are deleted immediately — you can `terraform apply` again tomorrow without
hitting "already scheduled for deletion".

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `terraform apply` fails with "data source not found for zone" | `hosted_zone_name` doesn't exist in Route 53 | Create the hosted zone first (or delegate your registrar's NS records). |
| `archive_file` fails during `terraform apply` | You didn't run `npm run build:lambdas` | `cd app && npm run build:lambdas`, then re-apply. |
| App refuses to start under `NODE_ENV=production` | No bearer token configured | `export API_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)` or set `api_token` in `app/server_config.json`. |
| Dashboard says **terraform not applied** in the Discord panel | `interactions_invoke_url` output missing | Re-run `cd app && npm run build:lambdas && cd ../terraform && terraform apply`. |
| Dashboard says **awaiting credentials** | Secrets still contain the Terraform `"placeholder"` seed | Paste the real bot token + public key in the Credentials tab and Save. |
| Discord rejects the interactions URL with "invalid interactions endpoint URL" | Public key in Secrets Manager doesn't match Discord's | Re-copy the Application Public Key from the Developer Portal and Save. |
| `/server-*` slash commands don't appear in Discord | Per-guild registration not done | Guilds tab → **Register commands** next to the guild ID. |
| `/server-start` says "You don't have permission" | Your user/role isn't in admins or per-game permissions, or the `start` action isn't ticked | Admins tab or Per-Game Permissions tab, then retry. |
| Task reaches RUNNING but DNS never updates | update-dns Lambda errored; EventBridge rule might be disabled | Check the Lambda's CloudWatch logs; verify the EventBridge rule is enabled. |
| Watchdog stops tasks too aggressively | Low `watchdog_min_packets`, short `watchdog_interval_minutes`, or low `watchdog_idle_checks` | Tune the three knobs via the dashboard **Server Config** panel and re-apply. |
